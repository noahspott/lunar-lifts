    question: "How does the rental process work?",
    answer:
      "Easy. You pick the inflatable, tell us when and where, and we handle the rest. We deliver, set up, and come back after your event to take it all down. You? You just enjoy the party.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are your bounce houses actually clean?",
    answer:
      "Spotless. No weird smells, no mystery stains, no sketchy patches. Every inflatable is deep-cleaned and inspected before it arrives at your event. If it's not Lunar Lifts clean, it doesn't go out.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if it rains on my event day?",
    answer:
      "We get it—weather happens. If it's looking stormy, we'll work with you to reschedule or cancel if needed. No one wants a soggy bounce house.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much space do I need?",
    answer:
      "A standard backyard usually does the trick! We'll give you exact dimensions for your inflatable and help you make sure there's enough room for max fun and safety.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I book?",
    answer:
      "However you like—call, email, or fill out our contact form. We actually respond. Then we'll confirm your details, lock in your date, and you're good to go!",
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book my bounce house rental?",
    answer:
      "As soon as you know your date, lock it in. Weekends in New Mexico book up fast—especially during peak party season. Don't wait. Seriously.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you deliver outside the city?",
    answer:
      "Yep. We serve most of the surrounding areas in New Mexico. Just drop your address in the form or give us a call—we'll confirm delivery details fast.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to clean the bounce house after the party?",
    answer:
      "Nope. We've got it covered. We handle setup, takedown, and all the cleaning. You just enjoy the party—and maybe grab a slice of cake.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the cancellation policy?",
    answer:
      "Life happens. Cancel up to 24 hours before your event for a full refund. We're not here to nickel-and-dime you—we're here to make your life easier.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do I get to keep the bounce house?",
    answer:
      "All day. Seriously. We drop it off, set it up, and come back after the party. You don't need to watch the clock—the fun doesn't stop until you do.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a power source?",
    answer:
      "Yep, but if you don't have one close by, we've got generators available. Just let us know—we'll make it easy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you do corporate or school events?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We handle fundraisers, field days, school parties, company picnics—you name it. If you need clean, professional inflatables, we're your people.",
  },
